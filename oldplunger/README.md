# Oldplunger

WIP Discord mod, only usable on Oldcord.

The AOT part of Oldplunger is still at `/www_assets/bootloader/patcher.js` which we intend to put in here, along with the shimming.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Patch webpack
- [ ] Plugin api
- [ ] AOT and shims (for Electron Compat and use Oldcord API/Gateway)

## How to make plugins

**⚠️ If you do not know what you're doing, including people who only made (current year) plugins for XYZ client mod without any 2015-2018 experience, don't (or do it at your own risk)!**

We intend to make our plugin system similar to how Vencord does (but not API compatible). If you want to, [check out this guide](https://gist.github.com/sunnniee/28bd595f8c07992f6d03289911289ba8),
just replace Vencord things with Oldplunger things, for example, definePlugin -> plain old export default. Shifting your mind from (current year) to 2015-2018 works too, a.k.a. don't blindly follow the guide.
