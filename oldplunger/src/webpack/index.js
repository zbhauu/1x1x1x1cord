/*
 Following Vencord, I think this webpack folder does the following:
 - Webpack Tools (find[Something])
 - Patching by injecting to Webpack's module factory, converting to string, regex patch...? and then turn string back to a function
 - Export React and other tools (useful for backporting the report modal, reply functionality and server banners)
