<!-- Oldcord: bring back the past -->

# OldcordV3

An open-source reimplementation of the old (2015-2018) Discord backend, including an on-demand client patcher. <br>
Contributions are highly encouraged! We'd love your help to clean and refactor the codebase!

## ⚠️ Important Notices

**Database Migrations**:

- The database schema can change between updates. When this happens, we will provide SQL migration scripts to upgrade existing databases, **some of these scripts may run automatically on start**.

**Configuration File**:

- **Always ensure your config.json file matches the structure and entries in config.example.json when you pull new updates.** Instances created before November 14, 2024, must update their configuration file to the new format to function.

**Node.js update**:

- **If you have your own Oldcord instance before October 5, 2025, please update your Node.js version to either the latest LTS version or the latest version.** This is because of the new Selector update requiring the latest Node.js version to build.

**Help Wanted**! <br>
There are some features we need help with, if you're up for the task, feel free to submit a PR!

- Audit Logs
- Giphy Integration
- The other social media platforms (not just Twitch) for account connections
- Refactor/Improve code
- Full fledged Discord mod to replace the current patching system (Oldplunger)
- Admin panel
- Reworking the existing webhooks implementation & webhook overrides.

## Project Status & Features

**Support Status for Features from Client Year**:

- 🟢 **2015 - 2016**: Full support.
- 🟠 **2017 - 2018**: In development, mostly supported. (To-dos like giphy support, etc)
- ❎ **2019+**: No plans for support. Too much commercial crap in these versions, we're focused on preserving the classic Discord experience, completely free from telemetry and bloat.

**Voice & Video**:

- **Voice**: 🟠 Work in progress, but functional via WebRTC P2P, standard WebRTC (Browser), and UDP (Desktop Client).
  - **Known Issues**: Minor bugs like speaker indicators not showing, firefox not working, or needing to rejoin a call to hear/speak to others are being actively worked on.
  - **Note**: WebRTC requires the "Modernize WebRTC" patch to be enabled in order to work properly. Running Oldcord behind a firewall like Cloudflare would not work well with UDP (affecting both standard WebRTC and Desktop Client) and will disconnect upon joining unless [MediaProxyAgent](https://github.com/oldcordapp/MediaProxyAgent) has been set up and configured in `config.json`.
- **Video**: 🔴 Not yet supported. Our current focus is on ensuring voice chat works 100% of the time with little to no issues.
- **Moderation Features**: 🔴Server mute and deafen are planned and actively being worked on.

**Alternative Clients**:

- **Quick note**: Creating/editing servers, editing profile options and other things might cause issues due to our focus on v2-v6 and supporting multiple different API versions.
- **Compatibility**:
  - **Fermi**: 🟠 Loads, but things are not working still. Work in progress
  - **Endcord**: 🟠 Loads, but things are not working still. Work in progress

**Mobile Clients**:

- **Compatibility**:
  - **Android Discord Kotlin (2015-2022)**: 🟠 Work in progress.
  - **Android Discord React Native (2022+)**: ❎ No plans for support.
  - **iOS Discord React Native (2015+)**: ❎ No plans for support due to needing a Jailbroken device.

**Desktop Client**:

- **Note**: We only support the latest Discord desktop clients (Stable, PTB, Canary, Development) or ones that repackaged from it. Older versions are not recommended.
- **Compatibility**: 🟠 Work in progress

## Setup Guide

**Prerequisites**:

- A running PostgreSQL server.
- Node.js and npm.

**Installation**:

1. **Setup the Database**: Create a new database via PgAdmin or commandline for PostgreSQL, make sure this database (user & password login as well) matches what's in your future config.json file.
2. **Install Dependencies**: In the project directory, run the command `npm install`.
3. **Configure**: Copy `config.example.json` to a new file named `config.json`. Edit the values to match your setup (See the configuration section below for further details).
4. **Start the Server**: Run the command `npm run start`.

**Configuration** (`config.json`):

- `custom_invite_url`: Sets the domain for your instance's invite links (e.g., setting it to example.com will make it so every invite has the prefix example.com - similar to discord.gg)
- `Google reCAPTCHA`: To enable, provide a `site_key`, `secret_key` and change `enabled` to `true`. Do the opposite (`enabled` to `false`) to disable.
  - **IMPORTANT**: The default keys are for demo purposes, **all answers will be marked as valid**, you MUST change these for a production environment.
- `integration_config`: Manages in-app connections (e.g, Twitch). You'll need to create developer applications on these platforms (like Twitch) to get a `client_id` and `client_secret`.
  ```json
    "integration_config" : [{
      "platform" : "twitch",
      "client_id" : "client_id",
      "client_secret" : "client_secret",
      "redirect_uri" : "https://staging.oldcordapp.com/api/connections/twitch/callback"
    }]
  ```
- `trusted_users`: An array of user IDs that bypass short-term rate limits. Useful for bots.
- `instance_flags`: An array of strings to enable special features or restrictions:
  - `NO_REGISTRATION`: Blocks new user sign-ups.
  - `NO_GUILD_CREATION`: Prevents users from creating new guilds.
  - `NO_INVITE_USE`: Stops users from joining guilds via invites.
  - `autojoin:GUILDID` - Automatically makes new users join a specific guild upon registration (e.g., `"autojoin:1413791197947867136"`)
- `includePortInUrl`: If set to `false` will force the server to use ports 443/80 instead of the instance port. Good for reverse proxies.
- `includePortInWsUrl`: If set to `false` will force the server gateway to use ports 443/80 instead of the instance port. Good for reverse proxies.
- `tenor_api_key`: Needed if you want `/tenor` support. You can get an API key [here](https://tenor.com/developer/dashboard).
- `auto_embed_urls`: Set to `true` if you want urls included in message content to automatically embed.

## FAQ

**What is WebRTC P2P?**

- WebRTC P2P is a peer-to-peer voice protocol found in 2017-2018 Discord clients. As far as we're aware, it was never officially used, it works by relaying connection data directly between users in a call.
- Because this protocol is **peer-to-peer**, **it will expose your IP address to other users** in the call. **It is highly recommended to use a VPN with this feature.**
