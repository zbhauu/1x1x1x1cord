Hi [username],

Thank you for taking the time to check out the [instance] Beta. Even though we're only one year old, I think the app is pretty awesome and delivers the type of voice and chat experience gamers have been craving for a long time. Still, the team and I are continually working to improve it in preparation for final release and your input is vitally important in helping us get there!

You can provide feedback, suggest features, and even vote on ideas proposed by other beta users at [domain]. We are keeping a close eye on everything there to determine which features the community wants to see next.

If you have an urgent issue that needs to be resolved please email [email] and they'll be able to help you out right away. The support team reads and responds to everything sent to this address.

My goal is to turn [instance] into the preeminent communication app for gamers and modernize how we all connect. Thank you for joining me on this journey. I hope you enjoy the app and am really looking forward to your input.
