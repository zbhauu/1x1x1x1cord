Hi [username],

Thank you for taking the time to check out the [instance] alpha preview. Even at this early stage I think the app is pretty awesome and delivers the type of voice and chat experience gamers have been craving for a long time. Still, the team and I are continually working to improve it in preperation for release and your input is vitally important in helping us get there!

Please feel free to reach out to me by replying to this email. Let me know if you have any feature requests, need help with something, or just want to share your impressions. I want to hear what you have to say!

If you do have an urgent issue that needs to be resolved please email [email] and [instance]Dan will be able to help you out. He gets to things a little more quickly than I do.
