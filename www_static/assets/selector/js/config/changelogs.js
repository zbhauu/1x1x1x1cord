Any flagged images will be deleted. You can turn off Safe Direct Messaging for your account under the User Settings > Privacy tab.\n  * **Global DM Privacy Setting:** a one-click global option so you can set whether or not you want DMs from non-friends. If you want, you can still override the global setting on a per-server basis.\n  * **Server Auto-moderation:** the new Explicit Content Filtering option will auto-detect and delete images and uploads deemed inappropriate. This is off by default. To enable this, simply check the Explicit Content Filtering option in server settings.\n  * More safety features are coming. Read the full scoop [here](https://bit.ly/2o3gueO)\n* **Removed geotagging** when uploading a photo to Discord from your phone because, honestly, we don’t want to know where you’ve been.\n* **League of Legends Beta client** is supported for Friend Sync.\n* **Improved performance of enormous servers** like Overwatch and Dreamgrove. Keep testing our limits, bruh. We got you.\n* **Fixed a bug** that caused users in Do Not Disturb to be heavily disturbed by push notifications on their phone :sweaty-towel-guy:\n\niOS {changelog-added-secondary}\n==========================================\n\n* Reactions are now on iOS! Respond to your friends with low commitment pictures instead of words (long press on a message to add a reaction).\n* Typing a message with up to 27 Emoji and no characters will result in the Emoji becoming what they’ve always dreamed to be: big beautiful Wumboji.\n* Search on mobile is complete: Now you don’t have to be at your computer to recall that obscure bit of info your buddy linked ten months ago. \n* Carry your Nitro perks from desktop with you to the mobile app \\- animate your avatar with GIF wizardry, use your server’s custom emotes anywhere in Discord, upload larger files, and see your Nitro-exclusive badge to prove that our love is real. \n* Even faster loading: We heard you guys had too much time to read the loading lines, so we turned some knobs and made Discord load even faster.

Sometimes you really gotta froth the f**k out of something to get the best brew. \n* **Fortunately, the logout button** is now easy to find in the new settings. Reclaiming your soul is easier than ever!\n* **Message sound** is no longer bound to desktop notifications being on. Get your beeps without your sweeps.\n* **Windows desktop notifications** should now always take you to the right message. All it took was a 12 step program.\n* **Desktop notifications clear automatically** when clicking on the related Discord channel instead of the notification (for Windows this requires Creator’s update due to a Windows bug).\n* **Push notifications are smarter.** You will now only receive a max of three notifications when a channel, server, or group DM begins talking because you really don\'t need to hear Blake and Mikey talk about high performance cars for an hour (you\'ll still get any @mentions thrown your way). This resets after ten minutes of no one talking or if you come back online. \n* **Friend requests and suggestions** put on a sweet pair of sunglasses and are now respected by your desktop notification settings.\n* **Right click and invite to server** now always works :) hehehehe\n* **Extracting link information** has never been sexier. For example:\n  * Tweets look nicer.\n  * XKCD is supported.\n  * Favorite GIF services should embed faster.\n  * Content is better sanitized from many sites. Less icky.\n* **NSFW Channels** now exist. Please mark your NSFW zones. The explicit content filter will only remove illegal content in these channels.\n\nAndroid Stuff {changelog-added-secondary}\n==========================================\n\n* **Added a sick nasty emoji picker** with custom emojis and emoji search it\'s really slick, AndyG bled for this.\n* **Long press a message to add reactions.** PRESS YOUR EMOTIONS INTO THE SCREEN. Also, there\'s a button.\n* **Moderation section** also added to server settings so you can moderate on the go go.\n* **Our Android app is all aboard the polish train** to slick city right now. In fact, here\'s some more polish:\n  * Direct download images and files instead of opening in browser.\n  * Discord invite links will now open directly in the app.\n  * Notifications will auto-clear when associated messages are read. Peek-a-boo!\n  * General connectivity/stability improvements.\n* **Added Privacy & Safety** section to user settings.\n* **NSFW channels** are also also supported on Android.\n\n\nOther Cool Things {changelog-added-secondary}\n==========================================\n\n* **Want to rep Discord?** [Join the HypeSquad](https://discordapp.com/hypesquad) and let Discord support your gaming community.\n* **Like C\\+\\+ and mentoring other engineers?** We need a boss engineer to come work on projects like our Overlay, SDK, Voice Chat, and Video Chat.

Channels in that category inherit those permissions.\n  * Channel permissions can be unsynced to a category \\- allowing you to *level up* your permissions to the *next level* within a category itself.\n  * You can collapse a category to hide channels. Unread messages will bring the channel up. It’s cool, test it out to see what I mean.\n  * Don\'t care about all that anime discussion? Good news \\- you can mute entire categories!\n  * In an IDGAF mood? Mute AND collapse a category to hide it.\n* **New *next level* tooltip design** that\'s black and bigger instead of blurple and smaller. Stop smirking.\n* Video chat is still rolling out (at 40% of players currently), but **we\'ve *leveled up* our Video Chat/Screen Sharing layout** to a grid view.

Parentheses are text characters too.\n* Sometimes typing discordapp.com/invite in weird ways would create an invite embed. This weirdness has also been removed.\n* The emoji picker button had some graphical issues that we polished. Nothing a little emoji grease can’t fix.\n* Pinning two messages in a row (the legendary _double pin_) no longer marks your pins as unread.\n* Due to permission wonkiness, certain voice channels didn’t properly show locks on restricted channels. We called Lobsnok, the Locksmith of the North, to fix it right up.\n* Right clicking checkboxes no longer brings up the context menu because it’s literally a binary option and this was madness.\n* When editing a message that mentions a user with a unicode emoji in their name, it no longer replaces the emoji with :textlikethis: \\:poop\\: \\:100\\:\n* We fixed this thing where you couldn’t mute yourself in the overlay. Now you can mute yourself in the overlay.\n* Fixed some jankiness when someone deleted a message in a channel that was previously marked as unread.\n* Furthermore, any empty channel (literally no message or they were all deleted) will be considered read because _there is nothing to read._ It’s like telepathy but way less useful.\n\nThese are 4 your fone :^) {improved}\n====================================\n\n* It’s October, so you know what that means!

It won\'t ring if you\'re not friends though.\n* **iPhone X** support is.\n* **Discord automatically logs you into the desktop app** if you’re already logged into our web app when you download the desktop app which is very seamless unlike this run on sentence.\n\nBUGS BE GONE {fixed}\n=====================\n\n* Selecting a group DM of one member no longer confuses Discord and crashes the client.\n* Closing a DM now stops any incoming calls from that DM for when you need to metaphorically \'slam the telephone\' on the receiver which is, I\'m guessing, a foreign concept to anyone under the age of 20.\n* You can now select the current date in the search filter. Now is today which exists so it’s there.\n* We put on a scary mask to make stubborn yet easily spooked unread indicators on empty channels go away.\n* We made the gravitational constant larger so that message history will not randomly jump around when returning to channels.\n* You can now mute yourself in the overlay again because you need to shut up.\n* Tableflip verification now properly shows a ten minute timer for new members instead of lying to you.\n* E\\-Mail notifications for missed messages are now sending instead of not sending because we broke it and didn’t realize for months #engineeringproblems\n* Unsmushed the avatar shape in the audit log user filter.\n\nHey, Listen! {progress}\n=====================\n\n* Want to support Discord’s development?
